                <p class='case_b03'>Lalashan heliport in Fuxing Township, Taoyuan County is an alpine heliport. The Department of Health entrusted Jendong to plan and construct a heliport for medical emergency rescue helicopters for residents and climbers of remote mountain areas in 2005.</p>
                <p class='case_b04'>Challenges</p>
                <p class='case_b03'>Due to remote location and difficult accessibility, coupled with unstable weather condition and harsh environmental constraints, the initial planning team spent a lot of time and made a great deal of effort in study and integration of various resources. In addition, consideration for convenient future maintenance and budget limit made the project even more difficult and challenging. </p>
                <p class='case_b04'>Solution</p>
                <p class='case_b03'>After detailed study by the team of Ｍott MacDonald from the UK and consideration of cost-benefit ratio, we decided to increase the budget of materials and equipment to effectively decrease the maintenance time and enhance convenience. The most critical decisions are: (1) selection of high-strength and water-resistant stainless steel embedded ground guidance light modules in response to the foggy and humid environment in mountains and to greatly reduce maintenance/repair cycle; and (2) configuration of a 24hr real-time web monitoring security system in the airport to make disaster prevention and management of rescue resources more efficient, which also allows effective control of regular maintenance. </p>
                <div class='case_b05'><img src='img/case01.jpg'></div>
                <p class='case_b04'>Value and benefits</p>
                <p class='case_b03'>After several natural disasters, the time it takes to deliver supplies has been reduced by nearly 5 times. It also plays an important role in the assistance of delivery of the injured for medical purpose, which has enhanced the survival rate of urgent patients. Lalashan Airport has become a good demonstration for disaster relief drill between local tribes and the government agencies.</p>

                <p class='case_b03'>The trolleys adopting international standard specification allow travelers in and out of Taichung Airport to be able to move smoothly in the airport.</p>
                <p class='case_b04'>Challenges</p>
                <p class='case_b03'>The airports in Taiwan usually comprise moving walkways which connect upper and lower floors. It is a big challenge to design trolleys that have special break mechanism that can achieves absolute balance when loaded with luggage while allowing trolleys to move freely between upper and lower floors on moving walkways.  </p>
                <p class='case_b04'>Solution</p>
                <p class='case_b03'>We have designed four-wheel trolleys which are made of stainless steel or aluminum alloy, durable, light weight and easy to use. The break system is specially designed for moving walkways in order to enhance balance of the four wheels. In addition, the loading complies with international standard of safety. The trolleys in the Taichung Airport have the highest degree of mobile balance among all airports in Taiwan.  </p>

                     • It was named the trolley system with the highest degree of mobile balance among all airports in Taiwan when it was introduced.
                <br/>• The manufacture of airport trolleys in Taiwan was officially moved from manual welding assembly to the era of mass production on production lines, and the user experience of trolleys was elevated to the level of international standards.</p>

                <p class='case_b02'>It is a civil aviation heliport located near the sea and reef region for transport of passengers. </p>

                <p class='case_b03'>The heliports located at Nangan, Beigan, Dongju and Xiju in Lienchiang County are civil aviation heliports built for local residents and visitors, which was entrusted by the government of Lienchiang County in 2007. </p>
                <p class='case_b04'>Challenges</p>
                <p class='case_b03'>It is located at sea reef region and easily affected by wind direction and fog-prone weather. Due to such inherent limitations for infrastructure, how to properly use resources was the biggest question in the project. In addition, this heliport will be used for medical emergency and rescue in the future, which makes the project even more challenging. </p>
                <p class='case_b04'>Solution</p>
                <p class='case_b03'>In response to the harsh and fog-prone climatic conditions at the seaside, after careful study by Jendong andＭott’s team, high-lumens and high-penetration embedded ground guidance light modules were adopted, which can still successfully and effectively guide helicopters to access the heliport so that passengers and crew members can have the highest safety protection. In addition, simple emergency rescue equipment was configured at the surroundings of the airport, which allows quick and immediate handling and minimizes disaster and injuries when disasters occur. </p>

                <p class='case_b04'>Value and benefits</p>
                <p class='case_b03'>In addition to passenger transport and reduction of transport volume of civil aircrafts, the Matsu heliport also has other functionality. For example, it serves as a medical emergency rescue airport, which provides residents immediate medical logistical assistance, reduce evacuation time and enhance medical quality.  Moreover, it connects the transportation network among offshore islands (Nangan, Beigan, Dongju and Xiju) and enhances quality of living and tourism. Finally, it acts as a hub for promotion of helicopter tourism and make the tourism in Matsu more diverse and prosperous. </p>
